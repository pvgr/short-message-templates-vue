    <h1>Short Message Templates with Vue.js</h1>
    <p>This app is a basic editor for short messages, with a couple of “extra” features. The user can use free text, location information and previously saved snippets of text to assemble a short passage of text, which can be saved as a <em>template</em>. I might convert it to a mobile app, to allow actually <em>sending</em> the messages as SMS, or connect to a <em>web to SMS</em> service — though this is rather unlikelly since it costs too much for a hobby! The editor relies on the <code>contentEditable</code> attribute on HTML elements which is a “web thing”.</p>
    <p>I made this app while I learn Vue.js and I mix and match various features, techniques and components. The code -while heavily documented- might be strange at times, or make little sence, and certainly could be done differently — it’s part of the process.</p>
